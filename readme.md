<p align="center"><strong>hill</strong> is a third-party design ecosystem for tools built on top of are.na</p>

## intent & goals
1. make building tools on top of are.na easy, accessible, and fun
2. contribute back to the community by listening for and addressing its needs, but spoken and un-

## what is a hill?
a hill is an are.na tool built within the hill design ecosystem. *note: if a tool consumes hill apis but does not consume hill ui, it is not, in fact, a hill.*

## what lives on hills?
### api helpers

hill comes with a set of api helpers that make consuming and interfacing with the are.na api dead easy. all you need to do is provide a channel slug and a callback, and hill will do the rest, like any good ecosystem.
### design ecosystem

the hill design ecosystem consists of two parts:
#### hill ui
this is the design system apps can consume to make themselves visually and functionally consistent with hills, making it, well, a hill.

#### block representations
block representations are immutable representations of are.na blocks that are style-consistent with the actual are.na ui. that means they have symbolic border color, correct type sizing, metadata, images, etc.
